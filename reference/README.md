# Reference

This folder holds **reference documents** for the project: material that is not part of day-to-day development but is used to retrace steps, onboard people, or guide consistent implementation.

- **setup-archive.md** – How joostkw.nl was set up (GitHub, Vercel, STRATO, DNS). Use when you need to change hosting, domain, or explain the setup.
- **project-spec.md** – Coding best practices and conventions for this project (the “spec”). Use when adding or changing code so it stays consistent; also for AI/agent-assisted development.
- **pixel-dog.md** – How the PixelDog component works, design choices, and how it aligns with the project spec.
- **commit-messages.md** – Desired detail level and style for commit messages in this project.
- **local-only-workflow.md** – Rule: keep changes local unless a push is explicitly requested.
